## Noble-Dream-Website

Main focus of the website is introduce Noble Dream Company which is not a real company but rather a company which i dreamed in my head and also let people know what their games about and get them as much support from fanbase as possible.

You can login to your account or register a new account and if you support the company for so long time you can actually get a discount or full game key. Again it is not real and i designed it to randomly generate a key.
